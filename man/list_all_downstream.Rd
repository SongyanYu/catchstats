\title{Identify all the subcatchments downstream of a list of specified catchments}
\usage{
list_all_downstream(cat.hier, catchnames)
}
\arguments{
\item{catchnames}{a vector of catchment ids for which a a list of downstream catchments
ids will be returned.}

\item{hierarchy}{a dataframe containing catchment id and next downstream (nextds) id fields}
}
\value{
a list of downstream catchment ids for each catchment in catchnames
}
\description{
Identify all the subcatchments downstream of a list of specified catchments
}
\note{
Function depends on the next downstream field in a stream network 'hierarchy' table (dataframe).
Can be used to support further aggregation of environmental variables for sub-catchments downstream 
of a list of catchments of interest (e.g. for calculating barrier numbers).
